Create a basic chat room application with Redpanda and Kafka clients developed with https://kafka.js.org/[kafkajs^].

This example shows you how to:

* Write a client application in TypeScript to produce and consume chat room messages.
* Build and run multiple clients to exchange chat messages streamed through Redpanda.

include::chat-room:partial$intro.adoc[]

== Prerequisites

- https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/[Install Node.js for your platform^].

- Complete the {docs-get-started-base}quick-start.adoc[Redpanda Quickstart]. This example expands on the quickstart. You can choose to run either one or three brokers.

== Run the example

Build the client chat application, run it from multiple client terminals, and chat between the clients.

. {repository}fork[Fork the `redpanda-labs` repository] and clone your local fork.

. Change into the example directory:
+
[,bash]
----
cd clients/chat-room/docker/nodejs
----

. Install the required dependencies:
+
[,bash]
----
npm i
----

. Verify that the `chat-room` topic exists in your cluster by listing all topics:
+
[,bash]
----
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic list
----
+
Output:
+
[.no-copy]
----
NAME       PARTITIONS  REPLICAS
chat-room  1           1
----

. If the topic doesn't exist yet, use {docs-reference-base}rpk/index.adoc[rpk] to create a `chat-room` topic:
+
[,bash]
----
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic create chat-room
----
+
Output:
+
[.no-copy]
----
TOPIC      STATUS
chat-room  OK
----

. Open at least two terminals, and for each terminal:
.. Run the client application:
+
[,bash]
----
node src/index.js
----
.. When prompted with `Enter user name:`, enter a unique name for the chat room.
. Use the chat application: enter a message in a terminal, and verify that the message is received in the other terminals.
+
For example:
+
----
Enter user name:
Alice
Connected, press Ctrl+C to exit
Alice: Hi, I'm Alice
Bob: Hi Alice, I'm Bob, nice to meet you
----

== Files in the example

This example includes the following files:

- link:{content-url}/clients/chat-room/docker/nodejs/src/admin.ts[`sr/admin.ts`]: Checks whether the `chat-room` topic exists and creates it if not.
+
NOTE: The broker settings in this code are from the Redpanda Quickstart, where the external port for broker `redpanda-0` is set to port 19092.
- link:{content-url}/clients/chat-room/docker/nodejs/src/producer.ts[`src/producer.ts`]: A producer that sends strings entered by the user of the terminal to the `chat-room` topic. Messages are sent as JSON encoded strings.
- link:{content-url}/clients/chat-room/docker/nodejs/src/consumer.ts[`src/consumer.ts`]: A consumer that reads all messages from the `chat-room`
topic and prints them to the console. You can start as many consumer groups as you like, but each group reads a message only once, which is why the example is using a generated UUID for the group ID. This way, each time you run the application, you see all previous messages.
+
NOTE: Because the `eachMessage()` function automatically commits on a heartbeat interval, there is no `commit()` method or auto-commit configuration in the code.
- link:{content-url}/clients/chat-room/docker/nodejs/src/index.ts[`src/index.ts`]: The client application that creates the topic, producer, and consumer and implements the chat logic.

== Next steps

This is a basic example of a chat room application. You can improve this application by implementing additional features and components, such as:

* A user interface to make it more interactive and user-friendly.
* A user registration and login system to authenticate users before they can access the chat room.
* Rate limiting and other measures to prevent spamming and abuse in the chat room.
