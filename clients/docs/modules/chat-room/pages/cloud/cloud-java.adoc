Create a basic chat room application with Redpanda Cloud and https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-clients[Kafka Java clients^].

This example shows you how to:

* Write a client application in Java to produce and consume chat room messages.
* Build and run multiple clients to exchange chat messages streamed through Redpanda Cloud.

== Prerequisites

- Complete the {docs-get-started-base}quick-start-cloud.adoc[Redpanda Cloud Quickstart] before continuing. This example expands on the quickstart.

- Install the following:
+
--
** Java 11 or 17 (OpenJDK is recommended)
** Maven
--
+
[tabs]
====
Windows/Linux::
+
--
You can download OpenJDK from https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases[Adoptium^], and can follow the installation instructions for Maven on the https://maven.apache.org/install.html[official Maven website^].
--
macOS::
+
--
Mac users with Homebrew installed can run the following commands to install these dependencies:

```bash
brew install openjdk@11 maven
```

Make sure to follow any symlinking instructions in the Caveats output.
--
====

When the prerequisites are installed, the following commands should print the version of both Java and Maven:

[,bash]
----
java --version
mvn --version
----

NOTE: Redpanda Cloud uses TLS certificates signed by https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt^]. Most programming languages will load their root certificate authority (CA), `ISRG Root X1`, by default so you shouldn't need to provide a custom CA certificate.

== Run the example

Compile the client chat application, run it from multiple client terminals, and chat between the clients.

. {repository}fork[Fork the `redpanda-labs` repository] and clone your local fork.

. Change into the example directory:
+
[,bash]
----
cd clients/chat-room/cloud/java
----

. Open the Java files and replace the placeholders wrapped in angle brackets (`<>`) with the same values that you used in the Redpanda Cloud Quickstart.

. Install the dependencies by building the project:
+
[,bash]
----
mvn package
----
+
The output is verbose, but you should see a successful build message:
+
----
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
----

. Verify that the `chat-room` topic exists in your cluster by listing all topics:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk topic list --tls-enabled
----
+
Output:
+
[.no-copy]
----
NAME       PARTITIONS  REPLICAS
chat-room  1           1
----

. If the topic doesn't exist yet, use {docs-reference-base}rpk/index.adoc[rpk] to create a `chat-room` topic:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk topic create chat-room --tls-enabled
----
+
Output:
+
[.no-copy]
----
TOPIC      STATUS
chat-room  OK
----

. From `chat-room/cloud/java`, compile the client application:
+
[,bash]
----
mvn compile
----

. Open at least two terminals, and for each terminal:
.. Run the client application:
+
[,bash]
----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.Main"
----
.. When prompted with `Enter user name:`, enter a unique name for the chat room.
. Use the chat application: enter a message in a terminal, and verify that the message is received in the other terminals.
+
For example:
+
----
Enter user name:
Alice
Connected, press Ctrl+C to exit
Alice: Hi, I'm Alice
Bob: Hi Alice, I'm Bob, nice to meet you
----

== Files in the example

This example includes the following files:

- link:{content-url}/clients/chat-room/cloud/java/src/main/java/com/example/Admin.java[`src/main/java/com/example/Admin.java`]: Checks whether the `chat-room` topic exists and creates it if not.
- link:{content-url}/clients/chat-room/cloud/java/src/main/java/com/example/ChatProducer.java[`src/main/java/com/example/ChatProducer.java`]: A producer that sends strings entered by the user of the terminal to the `chat-room` topic. Messages are sent as JSON encoded strings.
- link:{content-url}/clients/chat-room/cloud/java/src/main/java/com/example/ChatConsumer.java[`src/main/java/com/example/ChatConsumer.java`]: A consumer that reads all messages from the `chat-room`
topic and prints them to the console. You can start as many consumer groups as you like, but each group reads a message only once, which is why the example is using a generated UUID for the group ID. This way, each time you run the application, you see all previous messages.
- link:{content-url}/clients/chat-room/cloud/java/src/main/java/com/example/Main.java[`src/main/java/com/example/Main.java`]: The client application that creates the topic, producer, and consumer and implements the chat logic.

== Next steps

This is a basic example of a chat room application. You can improve this application by implementing additional features and components, such as:

* A user interface to make it more interactive and user-friendly.
* A user registration and login system to authenticate users before they can access the chat room.
* Rate limiting and other measures to prevent spamming and abuse in the chat room.
