= Filter JSON Messages into a New Topic using JQ

This lab contains a reusable data transform using `jaq` a rust version of the the popular `jq` command line JSON processor.

See the jq manual for more information on how to write a filter: https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/

Once you have a filter written, you can deploy this transform using that filter by setting the environment variable `FILTER`.

Environment variables:

- FILTER: The jq expression that will execute against record values (required)

To deploy this to a cluster you'll need to run the following in this directory:

```
rpk transform build
rpk transform deploy jq.wasm --name=<name> --var=FILTER='.myfilter' --input-topic=src --output-topic=sink
```
