This example shows you how to query live tracking data from the International Space Station and convert it from JSON to Avro using Redpanda data transforms.

This example uses cURL to query data from `api.open-notify.org` which is then piped through to Redpanda using the `rpk` command-line client. When the data is in Redpanda, it's converted from JSON to Avro using the transforms function. Then, you can see the converted data in Redpanda Console.

== Prerequisites

You must have the following:

- At least version 1.20 of https://go.dev/doc/install[Go^] installed on your host machine.
- The link:https://docs.redpanda.com/current/get-started/rpk-install/[`rpk` command-line client].
+
Install `rpk` on your host machine and configure it to connect to your Redpanda cluster.
- https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker and Docker Compose] installed on your host machine.

== Run the lab

. Clone this repository:
+
```bash
git clone https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-labs.git
```

. Change into the `data-transforms/iss_demo/` directory:
+
[,bash]
----
cd redpanda-labs/data-transforms/iss_demo
----

. Set the `REDPANDA_VERSION` environment variable to at least version 23.3.1. Data transforms was introduced in this version. For all available versions, see the https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases[GitHub releases].
+
For example:
+
[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
export REDPANDA_VERSION={latest-redpanda-version}
----

. Set the `REDPANDA_CONSOLE_VERSION` environment variable to the version of Redpanda Console that you want to run. For all available versions, see the https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases[GitHub releases].
+
For example:
+
[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
export REDPANDA_CONSOLE_VERSION={latest-console-version}
----

. Start Redpanda in Docker by running the following command:
+
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

. Post the Avro schema to the Schema Registry using a cURL command:
+
```bash
jq '. | {schema: tojson}' iss.avsc | curl -X POST "http://localhost:18081/subjects/iss_position/versions" -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json" \
        -d @-
```
+
Take a note of the schema ID that is returned from this command. In a clean environment this will be `1`.

. Set up your rpk profile:
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk profile create iss_demo --from-profile profile.yml
```

. Create the required topics `iss_json` and `iss_avro`:
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic create iss_json iss_avro
```

. Deploy the transforms function:
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk transform deploy --var=SCHEMA_ID=1 --input-topic=iss_json --output-topic=iss_avro
```
+
This example accepts the following environment variables:
+
- `SCHEMA_ID` (*required*): The ID of the Avro schema stored in the Redpanda schema registry.

Now, you can test that the data can be converted from JSON to Avro.

. Get a single record representing the location of the ISS:
+
```bash
curl http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json
```
+
Example output:
+
```json
{"message": "success", "timestamp": 1695753164, "iss_position": {"latitude": "-12.8784", "longitude": "92.2935"}}
```

. Paste this record into `rpk topic produce` as follows:
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic produce iss_json
```

. Consume the Avro topic using `rpk topic consume` and observe that it has been converted to Avro:
+
```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 rpk topic consume iss_avro
```
+
Example output:
+
```json
{
  "topic": "iss_avro",
  "value": "\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0001\ufffd\ufffd\u0011\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd)\ufffd\u0010X9\ufffd\ufffd\u0012W@\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u000c",
  "timestamp": 1695753212929,
  "partition": 0,
  "offset": 0
}
```

. Open http://localhost:8080/topics/iss_avro?p=-1&s=50&o=-1#messages[Redpanda Console] to view the decoded data.
+
image::iss_console.png[Redpanda Console showing the decoded message]

. Set up a loop to poll the location of the ISS:
+
```bash
while true
do
line=`curl http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json -s`
echo $line | rpk topic produce iss_json
sleep 1
done
```

== Files in the example

- link:{content-url}iss.avsc[`iss.avsc`]: Avro schema used for conversion.
- link:{content-url}profile.yml[`profile.yml`]: Used to configure `rpk` with the `rpk profile` command.
- link:{content-url}transform.go[`transform.go`]: This is the Golang code that will be compiled to WebAssembly. This code:
** Initializes the transform, including getting the schema from the Schema Registry and creating the `goavro` codec object (both stored in global variables).
** Registers the callback `toAvro`.
** `toAvro` parses the JSON into a struct `iss_now`, converts the struct into a map and then converts the map to Avro binary using the `goavro` codec.
** Prepends the schema ID using the magic five bytes `0x0` followed by a BigEndian `uint32`.
** This is all appended to the output slice.

== Clean up

To shut down and delete the containers along with all your cluster data:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
